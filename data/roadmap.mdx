This is a grind that can potentially take you **years**, depending on your pace. I highly advise you to not dive into technical topics like ML without first being strong with the **fundamentals**, i.e. Mathematics. 

Continually build projects applying everything you learned -> **Create Lots Of Value** (CLOV)! Participate in Kaggle competitions (treat it like Leetcode). It's important to avoid just accumulating theory without any sort of practice to cement it.

## Stage 1 - Data Analysis

This stage can more or less be completed simultaneously alongside stage 0. These tools are part of any skilled data scientist's toolset and you should focus on achieving **fluency** with data wrangling & analysis in python. Unlike full stack, there's not that many here to learn, so focus on depth rather than depth!

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- SQL

## Stage 2 - Machine Learning

Andrew Ng: https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/
Introduction to Statistical Learning
## Stage 3 - Deep Learning

Andrew Ng: https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/
Fast AI course: https://course.fast.ai/

Go through both courses. Andrew gives you more theoretical explanations while fast.ai teaches with pytorch (more practical) and hands-on applications.
## Stage 4 - NLP

Andrew Ng: https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/natural-language-processing-specialization/
Speech and Language Processing (The Bible): https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/

Hugging face NLP course: https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1
LLM University: https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llmu

## Stage 5 and Beyond

It's extremely important to keep yourself up to date with the latest breakthroughs and tech, as this is a **cutting-edge field**. Regularly read research papers.

Further exploration:
- Computer Graphics (e.g. OCR)
- LLMs and Vector databases
	- Llama Index, LangChain, Pinecone, etc.
- Responsively delivering value with ML: https://madewithml.com/
- Transformers and Transfer Learning
- etc.. eternal learning -> Intellectual pursuits!
