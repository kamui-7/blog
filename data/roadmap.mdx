We have compiled this roadmap as a way to navigate the vast field and countless amount resources. We hope this can serve as inspiration for those of you looking to formulate your own journeys.

Just a few special notes:
- Our tip is to build goals, actionable tasks, and deadlines surrounding this (or your own) roadmap to stay on track.
- It is widely recommended by the community to not dive straight into technical topics like ML having strong **fundamentals**, i.e. Mathematics. 
- Continually build projects applying everything you learned! Participating in Kaggle competitions is a great way to do this. It's important to avoid accumulating theory without any sort of practice to cement it. 
- This roadmap will be continuously evolving as we progress. 
## Stage 0 - Mathematics
- [**Linear Algebra**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011)
	- To get a visual intuition: [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra)
	- Stanford Review: [CS229 Linear Algebra](https://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf)
- [**Multi-variable calculus**](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)
	- Read Chapter 5 of MML book
	- Calculus I (Review): [Math Hawaii](https://math.hawaii.edu/~allan/Calculus1-Review.pdf)
	- Matrix Calculus for DL: [Explained.ai](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus)
	- Additional source: [D2L Multivariable Calculus](https://d2l.ai/chapter_appendix-mathematics-for-deep-learning/multivariable-calculus.html)
	- Visual Intuition: [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
- [**Probability** and **Statistics**](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home)
	- Statistics Fundamentals (StatQuest): [StatQuest YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9)
	- Visual intuition: [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)
	- Review: [CS229 Probability Review](https://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)
	- Review Book: [Probability Stats for DS](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/stuff/probability_stats_for_DS.pdf)
	- Learn PCA: [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c)
- Fill in any missing gaps: [Math for ML](https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf)
## Stage 1 - Data Analysis
This stage can more or less be completed simultaneously alongside stage 0. These tools are part of any skilled data scientist's toolset and you should focus on achieving **fluency** with data wrangling & analysis in python. Unlike full stack, there's not that many here to learn, so focus on depth rather than depth!

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
## Stage 2 - Machine Learning
- [Andrew Ng's ML specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
## Stage 3 - Deep Learning
- [Andrew Ng's DL specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/)
- [Fast AI course](https://course.fast.ai/)

Go through both courses. Andrew gives you more theoretical explanations while fast.ai teaches with pytorch (more practical) and hands-on applications.
## Stage 4 - NLP
- [Andrew Ng's NLP specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/natural-language-processing-specialization/)
- [Speech and Language Processing (The Bible)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
- [Hugging face NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1)
- [LLM University](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llmu)
## Stage 5 and Beyond
It's extremely important to keep yourself up to date with the latest breakthroughs and tech, as this is a **cutting-edge field**. By this point, you should have toolkit necessary for reading research papers.

Further exploration:
- Computer Graphics (e.g. OCR)
- LLMs and Vector databases
	- Llama Index, LangChain, Pinecone, etc.
- Responsively delivering value with ML: [Made With ML](https://madewithml.com/)
- Transformers and Transfer Learning
- etc.. eternal learning -> Intellectual pursuits!
