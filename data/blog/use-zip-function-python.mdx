This article will cover a guide on “zip” function available in Python’s standard module library. This method allows you to combine and pair elements of multiple iterable objects. You can then run further logic on these pairs. In many cases, using a “zip” function is much more efficient and cleaner than using multiple, nested “for” loops.
About Zip Function

As stated earlier, “zip” function is used to create pairs from elements of multiple iterable objects. Consider the example below to understand the basic syntax and usage of zip function:

```python
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = ["apple", "ball", "cat"]
zipped = zip(list1, list2)
print (list(zipped))
```

The first two statements in the above code sample define two lists containing some elements. Next, “zip” function is used by passing “list1” and “list2” variables as arguments. This is the main syntax of the “zip” function. You just have to pass lists or other valid ordered iterables as arguments whose elements you want to combine. Lastly, the print statement is used to get the output of the “zipped” variable. After running the code sample mentioned above, you should get the following output:

```python
[('a', 'apple'), ('b', 'ball'), ('c', 'cat')]
```

Note that the “zip” function returns a “zip” type object and not a list. You have to convert it to an iterable type, as shown in the print statement above.

In simple terms, “zip” function picks up elements of the same index from two lists and combines them as a pair in a tuple. So the 0th element from “list1” is combined with the 0th element of “list2”, the 1st element from “list1” is combined with the 1st element of “list2” and so on. Zip function moves from left to right and the tuple containing paired elements has the same index as the elements stored in them.
