## Week In Review

Week 8! We're officially 2 months in! Everything is moving so fat, but I think it's good to be proud of how far we've come. Still a looong way to
go as we will see.

This week we started ISLR (quoted as the bible of Statistical Leaning) and man has it lived up to its name. Abhay and I are both blown away
by just how focused every page it, how concise the word choice is, and how intuitive the explanations are. We've got a plan in place that encourages
consistency -- 10 pages per day. This is probably best since we don't want to overload ourselves with school and life in general.

This week we also took a crack at creating a presentation of Goodreads and it was good practice (although my presentation wasn't too presentable).
I think I have a basic understanding of recommender systems but definitely need a loy more practice.

Finally we brainstormed ideas fo TAMUHack and are confident going in.

### January 15, 2024
- FINISHED STAT 110!
- Worked on the Digit Classification

Reviewed Stat 110 with Abhay and realized we need to start ISLR. Also going to focus on Data Analysis with the next couple data sets. Digit recognition took waaaay longer than expected due to some bugs (one of which is still unresovled) but we’ll be back tomorrow!

### January 16, 2024
- Fixed the issue with Digit Recognition and got a score of 96% (could’ve gotten higher with more epochs but didn’t want to fry my laptop)
- Finished Chapter 1 and 2 of ISLR (no wonder Abhay was hyping this up; it’s insanely good already)
- Got started with Goodreads

“Success doesn’t go to those with a perfect plan but to those with relentless effort”

More to come!

### January 17, 2024
- 10 pages of ISLR
- Continual work on Goodreads
- Almost done with a Collaborative Filtering tutorial

Lots of other things going on today, but Abhay and I found out our first competition is coming up so we’re going to lock in for that.

### January 18, 2024
- Spent a good amount of time working thru the Goodreads dataset. You can learn so much from trying to understand a dataset and the patterns you see, and you’re so much better off when building a model when you have a better picture of the patterns in your data. Understand your data!
- Also spent time reviewing some Linear Algebra related to PCA such as Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues, SVD, and Spectral Theorem (eigen decomp). Felt great to dive back in with more knowledge than I did last time. I’ve gained a better intuition of PCA but now need to put in work implementing it

One step closer!

### January 19, 2024

- 10 Pages ISLR
- Reviewed Linear Algebra with Abhay, and Strang continued to blow our minds
- Almost done with Goodreads and I found a different datatset to work on after

Abhay and I have locked in our idea for the hackathon so we don’t have to worry about prepping so much anymore. We can focus on getting better. Step by step!

### January 20, 2024

- Finished Chapter 3 of ISLR
- Finished Goodreads off with a NN model using PyTorch. It’s accuracy seems to be still bad but I think that’s just an epochs problem

Our next dataset is a house prices prediction one and I’m definitely going to do more EDA on that and make it look more presentable. Goodreads is also something I can come back to once I learn enough NLP. 
One step closer!

### January 21, 2024

- ISLR 10 pages
- Reviewed Goodreads with Abhay and realized that my presentations needs to be a lot more presentable. Housing dataset is going to get worked by me.

I’ve been busy with some Hiring stuff and school stuff these past two days but I’m back to it now! The only 3 things that really matter in my life are CLOVing, Getting better at Webdev (need to start my NBA analytics page soon), and School. TAMUHack is just around the corner and we have a back up plan if we don’t think of anything else. One step closer!

## Goals for next week
- Continue ISLR
- Start Stanford NLP course
- Create the Housing Predictions Presentation
- Do our best at TAMU!
