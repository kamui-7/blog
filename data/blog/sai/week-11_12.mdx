## Weeks In Review

The past two weeks have been quite eventful for me. My classes began to pick up and I had my first interview for an internship.
I was proud of my consistency through everything and as we keep saying, that is the key to success. 

Success isn't determined by how talented you are, but by how relentless your effort is. 

We continue to push forward and learn no matter what else is going on in our lives, because we simply understand the concept of
winning. It's easy to make excuses and back out, but winning isn't easy. Nor should it be. I still need to improve in my ability to
jump back in after a break and of course, focusing is still a skill I'm learning. But again, I'm not looking at a certain result and doing
things to get there. Rather, I'm looking at areas of improvement and doing my best to improve. Deep in my soul I know that's what lies
at the base of success -- in every form.

## Progress Report

### February 5, 2024

- ISLR 10 pages
- NLP Assignment #1

Keeping it going!

### February 6, 2024

- ISLR 10 Pages on more types of non-linear fits and GAMs. It’s crazy how intuitive the ideas are and how rigorous the proofs and derivations are 

Didn’t have much more time today for NLP but we’re keeping it going! Won’t have much time tomorrow either but we’ll be back on Thursday with NLP lecture and more…

### February 7 & 8 & 9, 2024

- Finished chapters 7 and 8 of ISLR that talked about Decision Trees and Boosting
- Watched NLP Lecture  3

The past 3 days really blending into my memory and I didn't get to do too much work. I had an interview yesterday and I spent a long time preparing (although the questions I was asked weren't bad at all).

I think this is a good time to think about the fact of "obsession" that Abhay brought up this week. I think that a lot of our progress over the past 3 months has been because we're both obsessed with learning and winning. That energy is extremely contagious and we've been able to fuel it more and more.

We just have to make sure we're not rushing now as we move forward

### February 10, 2024

- ISLR first 10 pages of Chapter 9 on SVMs. SVMs were heavily mentioned in kaggle notebooks and in ML classifications in general so it feels good to get a good intro for them!
- NLP Lecture 4 
- NLP Assignment 2 derivations. The derivations were extremely confusing and at times tedious so I’m looking forward to reviewing with Abhay tomorrow and knocking out the implementation as well

Lots of bigs things coming as we plow through more and more learning. Relentless effort!

### February 11, 2024

During our CLOV session today:
- Worked through ISLR Problemsets for chapters 7 and 8.
- Re-derived assignment 2 equations and finally clarified our understanding fully

Nothing much but keeping it going!

### February 12, 2024

- Finished chapter 9

Nothing much today, just trying to keep up with school and ISLR!

### February 13, 2024

- ISLR next ten pages
- NLP lecture five on finishing up NNs, Introducing Language Models, and RNNs in Language Processing intro

Lots of recurring ideas (ha!) and lots of review/iteration to be done. Venturing into the unknown while being tied down to my knowledge!

### February 14, 2024

- ISLR 10 Pages on intro to RNNs
- Finished going through a2 Solution

Moving with more tomorrow!

### February 15, 2024

- Finished chapter 9 ISLR
- Lecture 6 NLP on more RNNs and LSTMs

Can't wait to do A3 and A4 tomorrow! Lot of incredible people you can look at in this big world, but you can't go forward if you're looking to the side!

### February 16, 2024

- 10 pages ISLR
- Lecture 7 NLP
- A3
- Linear Algebra practice

Tried to get through A4 but I think it required both our minds. Sora AI is insane, I can’t wait to learn how it’s built. CLOV day all of tomorrow!

### February 17, 2024

- ISLR 10 pages on chapter 12
- Self Attention Blog Post

As Abhay said, Axxess wasn't exactly what we're after so we just had a CLOV day. We reviewed and I learned the basics of self attention en route to transformers. Autobots roll out!

### February 18, 2024

In our CLOV Session we:
- Reviewed Backprop
- Went over A3
- Did the problem set for Chapters 9 & 10 in ISLR 

## Changelog

Nothing much to change except for the fact that I need to finish 9.5 lectures and A5 in the next 2 weeks so I'll need to increase the number of lectures
I've been doing.

## Goals for the next 2 weeks

- Finish ISLR
- Finish NLP lectures through 18
- Finish NLP A5
- Work on revamping our blog (!)
