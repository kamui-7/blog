## So far

Hey there, it's been a while!

All of March and most of April was spent on LogSense. We finished it off with the paper and final tweaks to V1 by attending the UTA Datathon 
to work on our first project. It turned out to be pretty promising, a lot to build on but a good first version. 

Then we spent our time cold emailing professors trying to research with them this coming semester. Professor Ng was the only lead we have and we'll 
look more into that this coming week. 

Then came the Summer.

Most of the Summer work I've been doing was Leetcode, Lab work, and my dashboards platform. As interesting as all of these have been, 
I've unfortunately shelved the most important of all of my endeavors -- CLOVing. This post is me (and Abhay) coming back to the world of 
deeper learning and adventurous wonders. We have a lot we want to do, but we've decided to start slow and build up.

## First week back

So this first week back, we're going to focus on 4 main things:

* Website Re-vamp
* Papers 
* Email Professors 
* Alex Xu Review 

Everything we want to achieve from now on aren't singular tasks. They're daily habits that we aim to enstill into our lives. Feels good to be back, 

### LET'S GET TO WORK.
