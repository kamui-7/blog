## Week in Review

Reducing variability worked wonders this week. Going back to having a more rigid structure in place for my day-to-day life was exactly what I needed
to not be overwhelmed by everything. Rigid structure results in a rigid foundation that cannot be shaken by the winds of the world.

Stanford's NLP lecture is genuinely fun to watch. The professor has such a passion for the subject matter and it really does rub off.
I do however need to do an assignment to connect all of the pieces he put forth in the first 2 lectures. I'm most comfortable in my understanding
of a subject matter when I can construct a story for it and I'm not able to do so for NLP currently. It feels like I'm holding on to pieces of a puzzle
and the assignments are how I put them together. Looking forward to that!

In terms of ISLR, Abhay and I realized that we needed to stop and review everything we've covered thus far before moving forward. We've been consistent but quick, so
it was beneficial to stop and regroup. There's still a bit of math that we don't really wrap our minds around, but that's precisely why we're pursuing a minor in math.

Spaceship Titanic was pretty bland. After watching Abhay's presentation, I realized that I should create more variables using relationships between the given
predictors in order to improve model performance. My model fared poorly in the competition because I used a simple NN rather than XG or Decision Trees and such. 
It's in the agenda for next week to do a better model and get a better score. Improvement is all we should chase!

## Progress Report
### January 29, 2024

- 10 pages ISLR

Continual work on Housing Dataset but mostly keeping up with school and recovering from tamuhack

### January 30, 2024

- ISLR Chapter 2 and 3 Review (we decided to do reviewing for the rest of week before we go further into the text)
- Almost done with Housing

### January 31, 2024

- Didn't have much time to work today due to school but need to put the finish touches on Housing

### February 1, 2024

- ISLR Review
- Finished Housing (finally)

Just keeping it going!

### February 2, 2024

- 1 lecture NLP
- Feature Engineering and Imputing for Spaceship Titanic

Lot of things coming up! Stay locked in!

### February 3, 2024

- Reviewed up until chapter 6 of ISLR in preparation to the 6 chapter review session tomorrow
- Finished Spaceship Titanic. Performed some analysis and fed it into a NN

Nothing much but keeping it going!

### February 4, 2024

- Watched half of Lecture 3 NLP
- Reviewed ISLR with Abhay

This week has been the bare minimum at best due to external reasons, but I’m proud of my consistency through the ups and downs!

So far my project idea for Basketball Predictions is still on the runway (had to sideline that for a little while). I’m eager to start but need to straighten out some other things first.

As always, one step closer!

## Changelog

As I mentioned, we're focusing on assignments for the NLP course to make sure we actually understand the material. 
We're going back to 10 pages of ISLR per day to finish off the second half. We're also brainstorming ideas for big proejcts to beef up our resume.
No new kaggle dataset for this week.

## Goals for next week

- Finish the first NLP assignments and 2 lectures
- ISLR 10 pages per day
- Redo Spaceship Titanic to be better
