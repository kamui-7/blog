## Week In Review

This week, as the name suggests, was the bridge towards more implementation practice and less new theory. For 6 weeks now, we've gone all in on
theory, but we thought that it's time to dial back and really get comfortable with implementing these complex structures and programs.

In all honesty, I'm not too sure how this week began but I definitely won't forget how it ended. For most of the week, I was just trying
to do my daily tasks to be on path. But towards the end, when I tried to implement an LSTM model, I realized that I literally don't have
any idea how to start. Yes, I could explain the theory behind it and do the matrix multiplication for forward prop, but I didn't know
how to start coding it. Which is exactly why next week is going to be practice-heavy. Trying to bring my implementation game up to speed with
my theory.

### January 8, 2024
- Stat 110 Lectures 20 and 21. Covariance is quite interesting
- Week 1 of Course 4 of the Deep Specialization
- All the labs from Course 1 of Deep Specialization

It’s exciting learning about CNNs and more exciting to do more implementation. I’d like days like this to be the average, just enough work to be consistent.

### January 9, 2024
- Stat 110 Lectures 22 and 23; today’s lectures were quite riveting since the prof name-dropped some exciting ideas
- Deep Learning Week 2 of Course 4
- Finished the labs for Course 2 and 3 (granted, there were none for 3)

I wanted to do everything I had to do to stay on pace and do some Data Analysis work. I’m probably going to continue that for a little until I get the most I can out of the IBM Certification. ONWARD!

### January 10, 2024
- Stat 110 Lectures 24 and 25
- Andrew Ng Week 3 of Course 4

I spent most of today working thru a Data Analysis course (which proved to be useless) but gonna get back to more practice tomorrow!

### January 11, 2024
- Finished Course 4 and Half of Course 5. Continuing plowing thru it to get to the practice
- Stat 110 Lectures 26 and 27

Spent most of the day watching Andrew Ng. Going to finish Course 5 tomorrow so I can catch up to Abhay and start Kaggling!

### January 12, 2024
- Stat 110 Lectures 28 and 29
- Finally finished all of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization. I loved the information but it was starting to feel too sedentary to just watch videos.
- I skimmed through the labs from Course 4  and they seemed kind of useful although I think really understanding the theory is more important as the extensive libraries allow for simple implementation.

Since I’m done with courses for now, the plan is to review the thoery for the next couple days while Kaggling (excited for that). Also going to review Stat 110 over the next few days before getting with Abhay to do a full review. Another step forward!

### January 13, 2024
Wanted to implement an LSTM for sentiment analysis on movie reviews but got stuck doing it from scratch and from pytorch. I think I might need to back up in terms of implementations and build up starting from RNNs

### January 14, 2024
- Lectures 30 and 31 of Stat 110
- Took a step back and watched a Pytorch tutorial on implementing an CNN
- Used the same website as Abhay to learn Pytorch NN fundamentals such as Tensors, Module, backward() and such
- Found a Kaggle competition to do analysis/prediction on

It was good to take a step back. I know more of the implementation now and feel better in going into competitions. Speaking of which, tomorrow will be practice with the NBA dataset I found with a digit recognition CNN as warmup. “KAGGLE DOODLE DO” - Abhay

## Goals for next week
- Get comfortable implementing CNNs and RNNs
- Practice with some Kaggles and Net implementations
- Get some Data Analysis reps with Goodreads
- Find the best schedule to balance School, CLOV, and learning Web Dev
