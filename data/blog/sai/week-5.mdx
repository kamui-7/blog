## Week in Review
As predicted this was quite possibly my least productive week of the whole year.
The downloaded labs and lecture notes weren't enough for me to effectively learn anything, and I had no internet to watch the lectures.
To add on top of that, I was sick on wednesday and thursday, which made it even harder to get anything done.

At the end of the day, I don't mean to be too negative since going on a cruise to Haiti was something I couldn't have even imagined as a kid,
and I'm extremely grateful for it. Being away from everything did increase my hunger for it and I'm in a better state of mind now that
I've had time away from everything.

## Progress Logs
### Decemeber 24, 2023
Read through the lecture notes for Lecture 16 (Stat110). I didn't understand it 100%, but I intend to iterate next week once I'm back home.
Also worked through the first half of Andrew Ng's Course 1 ML labs to really internalize classical ML. Also read 13 pages of the Data Analysis book

### December 25, 2023
Read through the lecture notes for Lecture 17 and second half of Course 1 labs. These were somewhat more confusing but I'm going to go over 
them tomorrow to reinforce them. Also read through 13 more pages of the Data Analysis Book.

### December 26, 2023
Worked through the second half labs again -- I understand them better now but definitely need the lectures to go any further. 
That also goes for Stat110 as everything feels to disconnected. Also decided to stop reading the Data Analysis book since it seems too
basic and unnecessary.

### December 27, 2023
Felt too sick to do any work, also went to Haiti so didn't have time anyways.

### December 28, 2023
Also felt sick, had to get rest so slept all day

### December 29, 2023
Finally back home -- Watched through 1 and half weeks of Course 2

### December 30, 2023
Wanted to finish Andrew Ng's course but was only able to get through Course 2. Also decided to go through vids first and labs throughout next week.

## Changelog
First and foremost, the biggest change is, of course, the change back to normal. It felt to get away from it all and reset mentally, but
it's time to lock back in. 

- We've decided that the Pandas book and the Data Analysis book are both useless for our purposes so we've left them. 

## Goals for next week
Again, the biggest goal for next week is building consistency after being gone for a week. As part of this, we'vw created a day-to-day assignment list
that looks something like this:
- 1 Stat110 Lecture
- 1 Andrew Ng Deep Learning Course per 3 days
- 2 Fast.ai lectures per day
- Practice using Kaggle projects

Of course, I need to finish Course 3 of the ML Specialisation before I move onto these goals, but I'm excited to be back and to take part in #DEEP2024
