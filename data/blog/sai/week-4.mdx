## Week in Review

This week was somewhat productive but felt unstable at times. I was able to get a lot of Stat110 done
but it felt unconnected until the review yesterday. Revisiting Calculus was definitely fun and it felt good
when Stat110 cycled back to things I learned in AP Stats.

The most exciting part of this week was surely starting Andrew Ng's ML Specialization course. I'm pumped to go deeper
and hope to get a lot out of the GOAT of ML.

## Progress Logs
### December 17, 2023
Reviewed Calculus during Review Session. Wasn’t my most productive day but progress is progress!
### December 18, 2023
Watched the first 3 Stat 110 lectures, read (skimmed thru) the first 2 Data Analysis Book chapters, 
and Finished the first course in IBM’s Data Analytics Certification
### December 19, 2023
Only watched one Stat 110 lecture and read half of a Data Analysis chapter. 
Definitely one of my worse days but I'm going to bed to get 8 hrs and get back on track tomorrow
### December 20, 2023
Finished 4.5 lectures and 1.5 strategic problem sets. 
The second half of the 8th lecture will be better learnt from the notes and textbook I feel like— 
just trying to learn the concepts of course. 

Either way, feels good to have a bounce back day after yesterday and I’m gonna keep it going by 
starting Andrew Ng’s course tomorrow and completely catching up on lectures
### December 21, 2023
Finished Lectures 9 - 12 of Stat110. The lectures are more understandable now since 
I'm deriving equations I already used in AP Stats (I never thought that class would be useful). 
Just goes to show how you can never connect the dots going forward, 
you need to put maximal effort in the present and everything will work out! 
Also finished Week 1 of Andrew Ng's ML Specialisation Course and got halfway thru Chapter 4 of the Data Science Book. 
Feels good to be completely back on track in terms of lectures. Abhay gave me a good idea of using a 
Kaggle data set to practice what I'm learning in the Data Science and I intend to do that whenever possible since currently 
I feel like I just have a bunch of unrelated pieces. Long entry, but good day! Can't wait to continue tomorrow
### December 22, 2023
Almost forgot to do the log but I went thru 1-14 Lecture notes and am looking forward to reviewing 
tomorrow and got to Unit 5 of the Data Analysis book. The pace will increase starting tomorrow
### December 23, 2023
FInished course 1 of Andrew Ng ML Specialization and reviewed Stat 110 first half. 
Had to spend some time mapping out the next week to make sure I have everything ready for any situations that might arise when I travel. 
I have everything set to achieve the goals we set for the next week before 2024. #Deep2024 coming soon...

## Changelog
- We chose the book "Practical Statistics for Data Science" as a way to gain some fundamental knowledge on EDA (exploratory data analysis) while bridging the gap in our descriptive stats understanding.
- Rather than waiting to complete probability (STAT 110), we decided to start the deeplearning.ai ML courses on the side, as a way to refill the motivation that was starting to wane off. Afterall, it can be quite easy to lose track of the end-goal with our (somewhat) bottom up approach to learning ML.
	- Therefore we reduced our STAT 110 pace to 1 lecture a day.
- We decided to skip the (fairly lengthy) problem-sets for STAT 110, and focus on the conceptual understanding. Although we may not gain the most rigorous and thorough understanding with this approach, we believe that over the winter break, it's a better use of time to finally start ML. Moreover, we have to take probability as a course for our degree sooner or later anyways.

## Goals for next week
Unfortunately, next week will probably be my lest productive week ever because I'm going on a cruise. 
I've downloaded all the labs for Ng's Course and all the lecture notes from Stat110, but I'm not sure if it'll be enough without internet.
At the very least, I'm hoping to stay somewhat engaged while also using time away as reset and recover before #DEEP2024
