## Weeks In Review

We've been making progress and that's honestly all that matters. 

My biggest takeaway from the past two weeks is, again, to simply focus on the next best step. This greedy approach to life is what's required and I have to come to grips with not being able to work in the future.
Stay rooted in the present and keep moving forward. Not much else aside from midterms these two weeks which slightly inhibited our work. But, again, we pushed through and took small steps forward. 

Always forward!

## Progress Report

### February 19,2024

- ISLR 10 Pages
- Finished Lecture on Transformers (Lecture 8 I believe)

### February 20,2024

- ISLR 10 Pages
- Read thru Transformers Blogpost again and it was honestly so eye opening. The ideas seem so intuitive yet brilliantly put together

### February 21,2024

- Finished the Chapter on Unsupervised Learning (only 2 more to go!)

Exciting progress through ISLR but didn’t do an NLP lecture today. We have due dates set for both and we’re fighting forward!

### February 22,2024

- ISLR 10 pages

Spent most of today brainstorming project ideas and catching up on school but I’m fully caught up and ready to take down NLP

### February 23,2024

- Finished NLP Pretraining Lecture

ISLR warp up tomorrow!

### February 24, 2024

- Finished ISLR!!!
- Halfway through NLP Lecture 12

ISLR has been quite to journey. Consistent is the name of story and I’m proud of our progress through it. CLOV session tomorrow and continuing NLP!

### February 25, 2024

- CLOV Session where we reviewed the last of ISLR and brainstormed more projects

First textbook I’ve ever read cover to cover! Loved the intuitions and introductions it provided. Hoping to take the knowledge as we plow forward

### February 26, 2024

- Half of NLP Lecture 13 on Coreferences
- Finalized our first project idea that also serves as our NLP Capstone

Heavy linguistics today, but it was cool to learn about how complicated language can get. Excited to read the papers necessary for our project and really get our feet wet. Continual growth!

### February 27, 2024

- Finished NLP Lecture on Coreference

Definitely need to watch some implementations to gain a better idea of the models. Again, this lecture was heavy on linguistics, but it seemed somewhat useful. Moving forward!

### Feb 28, 2024 & 29, 2024

- Finished Lecture 14 on LLM implementations and the nuts and bolts of different ways to fine tune models

Happy Leap day! Doing a two-in-one today since I didn't get that much done. The lecture was a lot of info but at the end of the day, it's more conversational info than knowledge I could implement right now. It was still really fun to learn about how these problems are being tackled in the real world. 

I have 2 more lectures and I can (finally) close the book on lectures. The information in these NLP lectures are invaluable and will most definitely be revisited, but I very much look forward to beginning my paper journey that Abhay started on this week. Speaking of which, I looked around to see if there was any paper I could implement for my personal NBA predictions project, but I think it's best for me to mess around and create my own since most of the implementations use the pre-made Python libraries anyways.

All in all, "the steps I take may be small, but I'll never walk backward."

### March 1, 2024
- Finished Lecture 15
- Started reading up on how distributed systems work, more specifically about HADOOP

I think handling Big Data is definitely a difference maker when it comes to ML, so I’ve begun trying to understand the fundamentals. Excited to finish NLP and begin our log project as well as my nba predictions project (which will most probably consist of simple, kaggle-like model). All part of the process!

### March 2, 2024
- Finished the NLP course with model analyses lecture

Finally began work on ball-net (my basketball matchup prediction algorithm), although the name may need to change if the final model doesn't end up being a neural net model. I set up my Postman and did my first GET for a box score for a Cavs vs Hornets Game and recognized the real need for learning how to handle this huge amounts of data effectively in order to draw insights on what's important for the model.

Log Project kicks off tomorrow!

### March 3, 2024

CLOV session:
- Reviewed NLP (almost all of the second half)
-  Abhay presented a paper he used for his RecSys project
- Laid the first framework for our LogSense Project

Individually, I also worked on getting training data for my NBA Predicitions project. I currently have the Postman Collection but need to get the JSON into CSV so I can do some good 'ol fashioned data analysis on it!

I also completed my first read of our first paper for LogSense. It's a paper about LogHub itself and I got a birds-eye view of the paper (as one is supposed to in their first read). It seems invaluable in understanding the data and previous models so I'm looking forward to diving deep tomorrow!

One step at a time.

## Changelog

LogSense will likely take up most of my time in the coming weeks and I cannot wait. Nothing much more to change other than ramping up working on my individual project now that I'm done with NLP.

## Goals for the next 2 weeks

- Stay consistent with the two projects I have at hand
