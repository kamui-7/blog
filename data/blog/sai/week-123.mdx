## The Week in Review
This week serves as the documented beginning to what I can only describe as the most transformational period of my life. 
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as a whole has captivated me for years now and finally am able to pursue it in its entirety. 
These 3 weeks have been heavily focused on Linear Algebra. Dr.Strang's 2011 lectures guided my studies as I went through his 3 Units. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the increasingly challenging curriculum and practices he designed and was genuinely engaged and interested throughout the course.
I definitely didn't understand Unit 3 thoroughly enough to gain a complete intuitive understanding of Linear Algebra, but I'm not afraid
to come back and iterate on it once I begin Machine Learning. For now, I believe I have the basis for the space of Linear Algebra even if 
I can't span its whole space. There exists a nullspace that will be filled as I plunge ahead. 

Towards the end of Week 3, this week, I also 
went head on into Multivariate Calculus. Calculus had always been my favorite subject of study (behind Physics) so grinding out Multivariate
Calculus from Khan Academy in 3 days was no sweat. It was heavily intuitional but I will need to do more practice to internalize the equations.
Equations are the language of mathematics and I intend not to shy away from them.

As I venture into Statistics (with Harvard Stat 110), the most important thing I must remember is to spread out the workload to not have to cram it.
Calculus had to be crammed due to my inability to spread it out. It worked out since it was Calculus but it definitely won't fly when
learning new material.

## Progress Logs

### 12/06/2023
Finished watching first 6 lectures of Unit 2. I'm mesmerised by the applications of projection and the elegance of determinants in relation to how much information they pack. Excited to continue with Lecture 6 problem set next

### 12/07/2023
Finished lectures 7 and 8 (my mind is absolutely blown by eigenvectors). Also watched 3B1B's visualisation of them to get a deeper understanding.

### 12/08/2023  
Re-read the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues lecture summary and watched the 3Blue1Brown video to get a better understanding

### 12/09/2023
Finished watching Unit 2 Lectures. I'm not sure I understand everything but I'll do more practice tomorrow. The emerging connection between Calculus and Linear Algebra is just incredible

### 12/10/2023
Reviewed Unit 2 by going thru the Unit 2 Exam Review and Exam (had to look at the answers for most of it). Worked on the blog website and mapped out next week's goals.

### 12/11/2023
Reviewed the Exam Review to get a better grasp of Unit 2 before going into Unit 3. Iterating on the material in an Agile Development-type lifestyle is proving to be beneficial. This week is packed with more Linear Algebra but also Multivariate Calculus -- I can't wait.

### 12/12/2023
Watched the first lecture for Unit 3. Absolutely PUMPED to spend the next 5 weeks diving into ML. With no Uni to worry about, I can spend my whole time dedicated to what I’m actually passionate about. Onwards!

### 12/13/2023
Went thru the first half of Unit 3. Slow start to the break but no way to go but up from here! Tomorrow is all about practice and finishing out Unit 3 as well as doing some good Calculus work (I love Calculus)

### 12/14/2023
Finished Unit 3 (last unit) of Linear Algebra. Definitely don’t think all the pieces are connected yet but I’m looking forward to revisiting this course later on when the math gets closer to ML. Also did 1/3 of the required Calculus curriculum (I love Calculus). Love gaining momentum as we continue to build!

### 12/15/2023
Iterated on website about us page design and reviewed the first third of Calculus through the articles. Slow day today, but slow progress is progress all the same! Consistency over all else

### 12/16/2023
Finished Calculus (I love Calculus) from Khan Academy. Most of it was extremely intuitionaly from Single-Variable Calculus but saddle points seemed interesting. Tomorrow we review and move on to Probability and Stats. One step closer to ML
